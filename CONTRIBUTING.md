# How to contribute

Missing a feature in the widget? Something does not work the way you
expect it to work? Please open an [issue](https://github.com/Submanifold/QtOSG/issues)
in the project's issue tracker. I am also more than happy to merge your
[pull requests](https://github.com/Submanifold/QtOSG/pulls).

Since this project is not really large, there are no coding conventions.
If you want to make me happy, just emulate my coding style. If you don't
like my coding style, I will just refactor your code prior/after
pulling. Let's be excellent to each other!
